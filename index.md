# My Story

Welcome to my corner of the web! I’m Sean McGovern, and I embarked on my journey into the world of Information Technology in January 2023, spurred by a New Year’s resolution to pursue my passion for technology and provide a better future for my wonderful family.

Prior to diving into IT, I spent five years as a field technician at Dish Network, followed by another four years at a security installation company. However, it was during my tenure at the security company that I realized the need for change. With a loving wife and three amazing children counting on me, I felt compelled to strive for more.

In pursuit of this goal, while still employed, I enrolled in a Udemy series to obtain my CompTIA A+ certification. With perseverance and dedication, I successfully passed both core 1 and core 2 of the A+ in March 2023. This achievement opened doors for me, leading to an IT support desk role at a small farming company, where I began in late April. The opportunity was transformative, as I found myself immersed in a role I truly enjoyed, working with fantastic colleagues and tackling diverse challenges on a daily basis.

Motivated by this newfound passion and sense of purpose, I continued to push myself to acquire further knowledge and expertise. Building upon my A+ certification, I earned my CompTIA Network+ certification in August 2023. Delving deeper into the realm of networking, I set my sights on the Cisco CCNA certification. While the journey to CCNA was undoubtedly challenging, I found solace in my growing fascination with the subject matter. In November 2023, I proudly achieved my CCNA certification, a testament to my determination and commitment to personal growth.

Presently, I remain dedicated to my role on the help desk at the small farm company, where I aspire to advance within the IT industry. Each day presents new opportunities for learning and skill development, and I am eager to seize them all. This website serves as a testament to my journey and aspirations, as I strive towards my ultimate goal of becoming a Network Engineer.

Thank you for joining me on this adventure, and I invite you to explore further as I document my progress and share insights along the way.
